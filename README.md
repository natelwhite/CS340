In order to write a maintainble, readable, and adaptable program, one of several approaches may be used. Test driven development, SOLID, functional programming, and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are just a few approaches that a programmer could use. For this application, I tested my program after each iteration and focused on the single responsibility principle within the OOP Paradigm. As a computer scientist, decisions like these are important to consider because they affect the testability, modularity, and readability of the codebase. The decisions for this project mostly revolved around the interface used by the client to access the database and the interface used by the user to operate the client. In the end, the result is a REST API with secure database transactions that has https endpoints to provide it's functionality to a browser context. Computer scientists may be network engineers, software architects, ai engineers, and the list goes on. Regardless of the specific title, computer scientists are generally hired to provide some sort of functionality via digital computation. In this specific scenario, it was to provide the ability to search thousands of animal records in a reliable and secure way. This same project could be reapplied to business data to perform data analytics on where the company could improve certain metrics.
